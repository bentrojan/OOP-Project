mastermind

starts as computer generated random code answer
refactor to allow human to make code, computer guess
	first computer randomly guesses
	then add some AI - if guessed right



game
	initializes board, random code answer [], guess tracker [], key pegs []{}?

	welcomes
		while variable != "P" 'enter P to play'

	solicits guesses
		guess = gets.chomp.split("")



decoding board
	12 rows
	accepts guess
	puts guess response
		checks if guess correct
			checks each peg if right - 4 slot array full of true falses
		checks if guess close


code pegs - for guesses
	six different colors
	runs through key 


key pegs - for response to guess
	correct, close, blank
